# Youtube Links Title Checker ðŸ”Ž

A Python script for checking the titles of each links in a text file and logging it in another file :)
<br></br>

_it may not be useful for you but for me it was a good help_ ðŸ’¡

---------------------------------

## ðŸ”¹Features

- Using [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) for scraping the titles of the links
- Using [typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) and [questionary](https://questionary.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for CLI
- You can choose between `headless` and `normal` mode for browser behaviour
- Creates a new file with the date for name to log the results
- You can easily give it any file that contains several links that are unknown to you

---------------------------------

## ðŸ”¹Requirements

- `Python 3.7+`
- `typer`
- `questionary`
- `selenium`
  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---------------------------------

## ðŸ”¹Installation

```bash
    pip install title_checker
```

--------------------------------

## ðŸ”¹Usage

**It's easy just make sure you have your links list and just run:**

```bash
    title_checker start
```
